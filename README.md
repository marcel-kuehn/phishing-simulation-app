# Phishing Simulation App

This project aims to develop a tool that assists companies in evaluating and enhancing their cybersecurity defenses against phishing attacks. Phishing poses a significant threat to organizations, and I believe regular education and exposure through this application can contribute to reducing its effectiveness.

While I try to design this tool so it's secure, it's important to note that the code is publicly accessible, and I cannot entirely prevent potential misuse.

**Disclaimer: If you engage in any criminal activities using this code, I bear no responsibility!**

I strongly discourage misuse for the following reasons:
1. This application lacks anonymity features, you will get caught
2. This application does not include features to gain access to credentials, which makes phishing with this application kind of useless
2. Choosing a path in ethical hacking or becoming a security professional can offer big financial reward and will enable you to do good in the world, instead of harming people
3. Numerous legal hacking resources and bug bounty programs provide avenues to train skills responsibly

This application is explicitly not intended for employee surveillance. Reports generated will only contain aggregated data, ensuring the anonymity of individual employees. I believe that if a company is susceptible to phishing attacks, it reflects a failure in adequately training their employees on security matters.

**Note: This application is currently under development and is not yet ready for use. I am primarily using it as a side project to enhance my skills.**

## Features

This project encompasses various crucial concepts and unique challenges, making it an excellent opportunity for skill development. Planned features include:

- **Campaign Management:** Easily create, edit, and schedule phishing simulation campaigns.
- **Custom Templates:** Utilize predefined email templates or add your own.
- **Tracking and Reporting:** Monitor email opens, link clicks, and file downloads through the dashboard.

Future additions may include educational resources aimed at helping employees recognize phishing attempts.
